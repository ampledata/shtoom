Working with Branches in Subversion
-----------------------------------

svn branching isn't as automatic as it could be, unfortunately. 
Merge tracking is listed as a "medium term goal" for svn. 

Sample::

 branchName=branchtesting # or whatever
 ShtoomRoot=svn+ssh://divmod.org/svn/Shtoom/
 svn cp $ShtoomRoot/trunk/shtoom $ShtoomRoot/branches/$branchName
 cd somedir
 # Either:
     svn co $ShtoomRoot/branches/$branchName 
     cd branchtesting
 # Or
     cp -a svntrunk $branchName
     cd $branchName
     svn switch $ShtoomRoot/branches/$branchName 
 # Make a note of the revision you branched from, or from inside the
 # branch checkout, 'svn up ; svn log --stop-on-copy' and find the 
 # last mentioned revision
 branchRev=671
 cd trunk-wc
 svn merge -r$branchRev:HEAD $ShtoomRoot/branches/$branchName 
 svn stat
 svn ci -m 'merging branch $branchName' [changed file list]
 svn rm $ShtoomRoot/branches/$branchName 

Current Branches
----------------

This is to track current and historic branches, including the 
revision which they branched from, and the revision they were
merged at.

rtp-sdp-refactor: branched at r676, not yet merged back in.
