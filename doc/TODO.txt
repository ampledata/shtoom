Mac installer: py2app roxors!
Windows installer: Innoconda, py2exe or cxFreeze. gtk from dropline.net. 
Linux installer: rpmbuilder??, deb?

New to-do before 0.3:
    - handle insane/broken UPnP gateways
    - firewall-seeding OPTIONS
    - make registration wait for NAT discovery
    - merge wizard and preference objects
    - clean up i18n, i18n textui and prefs help
    - finish auth cleanup
    - hook up lwc code
    - all interfaces must be current and correct
    - (maybe) DirectSound interface
    - doug: s.d.conferencing's entrance soundburst bug
    - phone: when on a call, decline a second incoming call?
    - set up a decent roundup instance, load all entries from TODO into it.
    - write prefs UI for an OptionDict
    - finish credcache
    - package for Windows
    - multiple registration support?

Old to-do before 0.3:
    - Handle a CANCEL and withdraw any incoming-call-dialog
    - go through and make sure Doug is up-to-date with recent refactorings
    - doug: use dropCall()'s deferred to generate correct events
    - doug: after a connectLegs(), forward on DTMF? How?
    - doug: flesh out leg tests, then voiceapp tests
    - use OptionDict for a new 'registrations' tab
    - documentation, documentation, documentation
    - document Doug API
    - update website
    - create shtoom wiki

Maybe before 0.3:
    - G.72x codec
    - doug: placeCall to a broken address doesn't give generate a 
      correct event
    - let doug handle wav and au files natively.
    - MediaLayer: a more sophisticated playout buffer
    - sip: retry registration failures (e.g. for testcall)
    - sip: move more stuff into the Dialog class
    - sip/call: the state should become an object, encapsulating the current 
      state, and the state machine. This makes it _much_ easier to handle 
      retransmits and the like.
    - RTCP + NAT == RFC 3605
    - A codec preference? Allow suppression of codecs, or preferred ordering?

Not before 0.3:
    - ui(qt): finish multiple Call UI, including new tab for incoming call
    - doug: more detailed involvement with call establishment (e.g. for auth)
    - a basic preferences object
    - redo Qt UI from scratch to not suck - use a layout widget, for one.
    - rport - do the right thing with it (ie generate received & rport for it)
      draft-ietf-sip-nat-02.txt is the relevant I-D
    - Investigate http://respyre.org/pyalsa.html for the fixing of mixer
      settings
    - sip: retransmit and timeout of BYE - needs Call/Dialog refactoring
    - rtp: detect SSRC collisions
    - doug, rtp: when mixing, generate CSRCs
    - rtcp: finish RTCP encoding -- RR, SR, PRIV. Handle strange extended
      SR/RR from ciscos.
    - rtcp: participant database
    - rtcp: generate sender reports
    - rtcp: generate receiver reports
    - rtcp: generate sdes
    - rtcp: notice when we get an RTCP BYE 
    - rtcp: generate a goodbye packet. should at least have an SDES and a BYE
    - audio(all) - if the call doesn't close cleanly, the audio isn't closed
      properly.
    - options: default some useful stuff
    - options: allow a sequence type. Multiple registrations, save call 
      history. Need an 'object' type as well (e.g. for expressing "sequence
      of registrations")
    - options: email_address must die, and now, in favour of 'AOR'. Use 
      'username'@'registerserver'? What to use if no register server?
    - ui(all): keybindings for DTMF. When a call is in progress, disable the
      address bar
    - ui(tk): A better dialog to prompt for user, password information
    - ui(tk): window resize currently sucks.
    - ui(tk): A better dialog for incoming calls. 
    - ui(qt): window resize currently sucks
    - ui(qt, wx, gtk): save call history
    - doug: create application frameworky bit (look at quotient.deployment?)
    - ui(all): multi-tab view for multiple calls
    - shtoomphone: ringing tone for incoming call?
      use a callwaiting type tone when busy
    - doug: expose the auth headers to/from the call?

Future:
    - bug: Why does calling from the web in quotient not work?
    - app: break base in two - phone shares almost nothing with doug
    - options: find a better place to put options files on windows
    - tests: Way more unit tests, clean up and checkin existing ones
    - options, app: Handle changed prefs, re-init whatever's needed
    - sip, app: extract realm from auth challenges and present it
    - sip: app.authCred should cache and re-use auth creds. 
    - ui(qt, tk): Timeout for incoming call dialog
    - ui(qt, gnome, text): A prompt for user, password information
    - ui(all): A way to popup an information dialog
    - sip: Connect up and debug shutdown hooks for removing registration and 
      closing any open calls (dropCall needs to return a deferred)
    - sip: Handle call failure gracefully - alert the user
    - sip: lots more error handling
    - sip, app, ui(all): a seperate debugging log for network level events
    - Handle more of SIP 
        - Lookup servers/proxies using multicast, SRV
        - redirects
        - retransmits. Needs Call/Dialog refactoring
    - EsounD support for Gnome, aRts for KDE?
      Note that aRts (and, I suspect, esd) only handle playing of audio,
      not the recording of audio.
    - Statistics display
    - New codec support: 
        - DVI4? Is this the same thing as audioop implements?
        - iLBC? - www.ilbcfreeware.org
        - G723? - patented, reference implementation available
        - G729? - patented.
        - QCELP? - patented, appears to be proprietary Qualcomm evil.
    - Putting calls on hold, allowing multiple calls to go at once.
    - Alternately, ad-hoc conferencing of new inbound or outbound calls
    - Gnome addressbook integration. Gnome notification bar integration.
    - KDE addressbook integration. KDE panel integration.
    - Mac OS X addressbook integration.
    - Native Windows audio - see 
      http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~hgs/teaching/ais/slides/windows_audio.ppt
      for an overview - DirectSound or DirectKS. It appears that WinMM isn't
      suitable.
    - Windows address book? Is there such a beast? Windows Messenger?
    - PGP integration for SIP
    - Crypto for RTP (via codec? what's the standard?)
    - Video. Capture is the tricky bit in a cross-platform way. Mac OSX
      already has a videocapture module.
    - dinsdale: doug's violent brother. VoiceXML.
      http://www.voicexml.org/tutorials/intro1.html
    - make shtoom.rtp work with mcast rtp, add a command line client
