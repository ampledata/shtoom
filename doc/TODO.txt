Mac installer: bundlebuilder
Windows installer: Innoconda, py2exe
Linux installer: rpmbuilder??, deb?

Before 0.2:
    - doc: write some end-user documentation
    - options: default some useful stuff
    - sip, app: support outbound proxies (e.g. fwdnat.pulver.com:5082, see
      http://www.fwd.pulver.com/support/configuration_guide/configure_your_fwd_certified_phone/kphone)
    - bug: Why does calling from the web in quotient not work?
    - app: break base in two - phone shares almost nothing with the rest
    - sip, options: remove hardcoded "anthony baxter" ;)
    - options: find a better place to put options files on windows
    - ui(gnome): Nag itamar or someone into writing the GNOME prefs ;)
    - tests: Way more unit tests, clean up and checkin existing ones
    - options, app: Handle changed prefs, re-init whatever's needed
    - sip, app: extract realm from auth challenges and present it
    - sip: app.authCred should cache and re-use auth creds. 
    - ui(tk): A better dialog for incoming calls. don't block, and have a 
      timeout.
    - ui(qt): Timeout for incoming call dialog
    - ui(tk): A better dialog to prompt for user, password information, that
      doesn't block the rest of the system.
    - ui(qt, gnome, text): A prompt for user, password information
    - ui(all): A way to popup an information dialog
    - sip: Connect up and debug shutdown hooks for removing registration and 
      closing any open calls (dropCall needs to return a deferred)
    - sip: Handle call failure gracefully - alert the user
    - ui(gnome): Re-hookup the debugging log to the GUI for all GUIs - 
      maybe need a hide/show option
    - rtp: Integrate existing RTCP code
    - sip: lots more error handling
    - sip, app, ui(all): a seperate debugging log for network level events
    - app: Hang up a phone call that is still "ringing":
      1. doesn't seem to stop RTP/RTCP udp ports
      2. if called broken address (e.g. "sip:") can't hang up
    - dist(win): Fix the fastaudio windows distribution - it needs to include 
      the libsndfile.dll file. I might need to switch to using Inno Setup -
      but how does Inno Setup know where to install the executable? How
      does wininst.exe build an installer? Default to C:\Python23 ?
    - dist(win): Examine py2exe 0.5
    - shtam: maximum message duration limit, much more configurability

Before 0.3:
    - UPnP: Hookup the discovery code in shtoom.upnp. 
    - UPnP: Finish forwardPort and cancelForwardPort. 
      Annoyingly, it doesn't seem like responses include some sort 
      of response cookie to indicate which query it is for.
      Needs SOAP client in Twisted 1.1.2.
    - Handle more of SIP 
        - Lookup servers/proxies using multicast, SRV
        - redirects
        - retransmits &c
        - Merge shtoom.multicast.SDP.SDP and shtoom.multicast.SDP.SimpleSDP 
          into shtoom.sdp, kill shtoom.multicast
    - Codec switchability - DVI4?, Speex
    - EsounD support for Gnome, aRts for KDE?
      Note that aRts (and, I suspect, esd) only handle playing of audio,
      not the recording of audio.

Later:

    - Statistics display
    - New codec support: 
        - G723?
        - iLBC?
    - Support RTP NTE (RFC2833)
      Uses SDP of 'a=rtpmap:101 telephone-event/8000'
    - More clients - shtoomcu (conferencing server)
    - Putting calls on hold, allowing multiple calls to go at once.
    - Alternately, ad-hoc conferencing of new inbound or outbound calls
    - Gnome addressbook integration. Gnome notification bar integration.
    - KDE addressbook integration. KDE panel integration.
    - Mac OS X UI and addressbook integration.
    - Mac OS CoreAudio support for Mac audio - fzzzy is working on this.
    - Native Windows audio - see 
      http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~hgs/teaching/ais/slides/windows_audio.ppt
      for an overview - DirectSound or DirectKS. It appears that WinMM isn't
      suitable.
    - Windows address book? Is there such a beast? Windows Messenger?
    - PGP integration for SIP
    - Crypto for RTP (via codec? what's the standard?)
    - Video. Capture is the tricky bit in a cross-platform way. Mac OSX
      already has a videocapture module.
