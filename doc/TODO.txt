Definite before 0.3:
    - sip: move more stuff into the Dialog class
    - ui(gnome): a new Gtk UI - Nafai
        - Re-hookup the debugging log to the GUI for all GUIs - 
          maybe need a hide/show option
        - Prefs support
    - ui(wx): move the UI and twisted to seperate threads. This will also be
      needed for mfcui. Implement through a stub layer that passes events
      between the event loops.
    - doug: implement placeCall
    - doug: implement leg conferencing (connection)

Maybe before 0.3:
    - Investigate http://respyre.org/pyalsa.html
    - sip: retransmit and timeout of BYE
    - rtcp: notice when we get an RTCP BYE and close the connection
    - rtcp: generate a goodbye packet. should at least have an SDES and a BYE
    - stun: timeout the STUN call, print a nice error
    - sip/call: the state should become an object, encapsulating the current state.
      This makes it _much_ easier to handle retransmits and the like.
    - audio(all) - if the call doesn't close cleanly, the audio isn't closed
      properly.
    - rtp, app, audio: pass the SDP to the RTP, so that it can handle 
      dynamic payload types. Audio shouldn't need to pass in the RTP PT.
    - options: default some useful stuff
    - options: allow a sequence type. Multiple registrations, save call 
      history
    - options: email_address must die, and now, in favour of 'AOR'. Use 
      'username'@'registerserver'? What to use if no register server?
    - ui(all): keybindings for DTMF. When a call is in progress, disable the
      address bar
    - ui(tk): A better dialog for incoming calls. 
    - ui(tk): new dialogs that don't block, and have a timeout.
        - A better dialog to prompt for user, password information
    - ui(tk): window resize currently sucks.
    - ui(qt): window resize currently sucks
    - ui(qt, wx, gtk): save call history
    - doug: reimplement shmessage and shecho in doug
    - doug: create application frameworky bit (look at quotient.deployment?)
    - doug: implement timers
    - doug: sending of DTMF
    - ui(all): multi-tab view for multiple calls
    - shtoom: ringing tone for incoming call?
    - Mac UI checked in - dp/bob
    - Mac OS CoreAudio support for Mac audio - dp/bob
    - rtcp: finish RTCP encoding -- RR, SR, PRIV. Handle strange extended
      SR/RR from ciscos.
    - doug: expose the auth headers from the call?

Future:
    - doug: write MixSource (for conferencing)
    - bug: Why does calling from the web in quotient not work?
    - app: break base in two - phone shares almost nothing with the rest
    - options: find a better place to put options files on windows
    - tests: Way more unit tests, clean up and checkin existing ones
    - options, app: Handle changed prefs, re-init whatever's needed
    - sip, app: extract realm from auth challenges and present it
    - sip: app.authCred should cache and re-use auth creds. 
    - ui(qt, tk): Timeout for incoming call dialog
    - ui(qt, gnome, text): A prompt for user, password information
    - ui(all): A way to popup an information dialog
    - sip: Connect up and debug shutdown hooks for removing registration and 
      closing any open calls (dropCall needs to return a deferred)
    - sip: Handle call failure gracefully - alert the user
    - sip: lots more error handling
    - sip, app, ui(all): a seperate debugging log for network level events
    - shtam: rewrite in doug
    - UPnP: Hookup the discovery code in shtoom.upnp. 
    - UPnP: Finish forwardPort and cancelForwardPort. 
      Annoyingly, it doesn't seem like responses include some sort 
      of response cookie to indicate which query it is for.
      Needs SOAP client in Twisted 1.1.2.
    - Handle more of SIP 
        - Lookup servers/proxies using multicast, SRV
        - redirects
        - retransmits &c
        - Merge shtoom.multicast.SDP.SDP and shtoom.multicast.SDP.SimpleSDP 
          into shtoom.sdp, kill shtoom.multicast
    - More codec support - DVI4?, Speex
    - EsounD support for Gnome, aRts for KDE?
      Note that aRts (and, I suspect, esd) only handle playing of audio,
      not the recording of audio.

Later:

    - Statistics display
    - New codec support: 
        - G723?
        - iLBC?
    - More clients - shtoomcu (conferencing server)
    - Putting calls on hold, allowing multiple calls to go at once.
    - Alternately, ad-hoc conferencing of new inbound or outbound calls
    - Generation of RTCP at appropriate times
    - Gnome addressbook integration. Gnome notification bar integration.
    - KDE addressbook integration. KDE panel integration.
    - Mac OS X addressbook integration.
    - Mac OS CoreAudio support for Mac audio - fzzzy is working on this.
    - Native Windows audio - see 
      http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~hgs/teaching/ais/slides/windows_audio.ppt
      for an overview - DirectSound or DirectKS. It appears that WinMM isn't
      suitable.
    - Windows address book? Is there such a beast? Windows Messenger?
    - PGP integration for SIP
    - Crypto for RTP (via codec? what's the standard?)
    - Video. Capture is the tricky bit in a cross-platform way. Mac OSX
      already has a videocapture module.
