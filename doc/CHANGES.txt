Major changes in the shtoom suite. In reverse chronological order.

0.2: NOT YET RELEASED
  - GSM codec works. (Needs optional pygsm package installed).
  - gnome UI cleanup, tk UI cleanup
  - New 'Register' button to register (after you edit registration 
    settings).
  - You can hang up a call that's in progress or failed
  - Additional (non-phone) applications available - shmessage, shtam
  - Tk interface more featureful - has most of the same stuff as the
    Qt interface.
  - DTMF detection in the non-phone apps. They don't do anything with
    it yet, but the hooks are there.
  - Works against XTen now. Slight mistake in RTP headers. Oh well.
  - Auth against old/broken servers that send challenges without a qop 
    header (for instance, Asterisk) works.
  - Can now prompt for user and password when needed (Tk only, for now)
  - Options now supports short options
  - suppress the config file being used with --no-config-file
  - Config file (.shtoomrc) added. This will save off any command
    line arguments that are supplied, as well as any set via the
    preferences dialog.
  - Preferences dialog added (to Tk and Qt only, so far)
  - Many bugfixes to the SIP handling code. Placing and receiving
    calls via a proxy now works.
  - Digest Auth support is done. This authenticates both INVITE 
    and REGISTRATIONs. At the moment the auth has to be supplied
    via a preference - this will be fixed, soon.
  - SIP REGISTRATION is done - this allows you to register with a 
    SIP Proxy (for instance, divmod.com)
  - The 'guts' of Shtoom are now in shtoom.app - the new Application
    object controls most of the behaviour of the phone. It creates 
    SIP, RTP and UI objects and handles the communication between them.
  - Major refactoring of the UI selection code
  - UPnP discovery is working, but not hooked up (not much point until
    the UPnP-using code is done).
  

0.1: RELEASED 2004-01-11. 
  - Initial basic calling UI done, for Tk, Gnome, Qt/KDE and command 
    line
  - Audio using either ossaudiodev or portaudio/fastaudio
  - Can make and receive calls
  - Supports firewall traversal via STUN
  - Uses either PCMU (8KHz ULAW, default) or GSM 06.10 (if optional
    pygsm module is installed).
