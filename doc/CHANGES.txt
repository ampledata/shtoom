Major changes in the shtoom suite. In reverse chronological order.

0.3:
  - doug can detect DTMF, play, record, and make outbound calls
  - wx UI is now in a separate thread to the twisted event loop
  - Large amounts of refactoring to call control to make it unit testable.
  - Doug: Call setup in doug is now a two-stage process - a CallStarted
    event is triggered first, the application then calls 'answerCall' or
    'rejectCall' on the leg in the event. A CallAnswered event then follows
    when the call is setup.
  - After prodding from Jamey Hicks, I've reworked the handling of
    the from: and to: lines in SIP, so that we can keep a dialog 
    up correctly. This has been extended so that BYE also works. We
    can now handle calls both to and from a cisco running IOS 12.3, from
    setup through to teardown.
  - Outbound proxy support is done (thanks to Jamey Hicks)
  - RTCP decoding is done. RTCP encoding is mostly done. As yet, nothing
    uses the decoded packets or generates RTCP packets, but it's nice to 
    see what you're being sent.
    Firewall issues mean that it's unlikely that two-way RTCP comms will
    work.
  - doug is alive. A first working version is checked in. Much much
    more to do yet.
  - DTMF sending is hooked up, and works in the tk, qt and gnome UIs
    DTMF sending works when talking to Doug and also talking to ciscos.
    Right now, though, there's a hardcoded assumption that it's RTP PT 101.
    This will be fixed before 0.3
  - A major refactoring of SIP internals and the handling of local and
    remote addresses mean it should be a bit saner and easier to 
    understand.
  - A wxWidgets UI was checked in. Thanks to Andy Hird for writing this.
  - The fastaudio driver, used on windows, received some TLC and should
    work on a lot more systems.
  - The return of RTP's connected port, after it was removed from 0.2 
    release
  - A major refactoring of the use of deferreds mean that things actually
    work a lot more sanely now. I'm chaining deferreds and using them to
    return data in a more orderly fashion now. 

0.2: 
  - RTP now uses a ConnectedDatagramProtocol. This allows for the
    detection of the other end going away abruptly. Still needs more
    testing for random weirdness. This change was backed out for 0.2,
    but will be in 0.3.
  - GSM codec works. (Needs optional pygsm package installed).
  - gnome UI cleanup, tk UI cleanup
  - New 'Register' button to register (after you edit registration 
    settings).
  - You can hang up a call that's in progress or failed
  - Additional (non-phone) applications available - shmessage, shtam
  - Tk interface more featureful - has most of the same stuff as the
    Qt interface.
  - DTMF detection in the non-phone apps. They don't do anything with
    it yet, but the hooks are there.
  - Works against XTen now. Slight mistake in RTP headers. Oh well.
  - Auth against old/broken servers that send challenges without a qop 
    header (for instance, Asterisk) works.
  - Can now prompt for user and password when needed (Tk only, for now)
  - Options now supports short options
  - suppress the config file being used with --no-config-file
  - Config file (.shtoomrc) added. This will save off any command
    line arguments that are supplied, as well as any set via the
    preferences dialog.
  - Preferences dialog added (to Tk and Qt only, so far)
  - Many bugfixes to the SIP handling code. Placing and receiving
    calls via a proxy now works.
  - Digest Auth support is done. This authenticates both INVITE 
    and REGISTRATIONs. At the moment the auth has to be supplied
    via a preference - this will be fixed, soon.
  - SIP REGISTRATION is done - this allows you to register with a 
    SIP Proxy (for instance, divmod.com)
  - The 'guts' of Shtoom are now in shtoom.app - the new Application
    object controls most of the behaviour of the phone. It creates 
    SIP, RTP and UI objects and handles the communication between them.
  - Major refactoring of the UI selection code
  - UPnP discovery is working, but not hooked up (not much point until
    the UPnP-using code is done).
  

0.1: RELEASED 2004-01-11. 
  - Initial basic calling UI done, for Tk, Gnome, Qt/KDE and command 
    line
  - Audio using either ossaudiodev or portaudio/fastaudio
  - Can make and receive calls
  - Supports firewall traversal via STUN
  - Uses either PCMU (8KHz ULAW, default) or GSM 06.10 (if optional
    pygsm module is installed).
