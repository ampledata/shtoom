Major changes in the shtoom suite. In reverse chronological order.

0.2: NOT YET RELEASED
  - Config file (.shtoomrc) added. This will save off any command
    line arguments that are supplied, as well as any set via the
    preferences dialog.
  - Preferences dialog added (to Tk and Qt only, so far)
  - Many bugfixes to the SIP handling code. Placing and receiving
    calls via a proxy now works.
  - Digest Auth support is done. This authenticates both INVITE 
    and REGISTRATIONs. At the moment the auth has to be supplied
    via a preference - this will be fixed, soon.
  - SIP REGISTRATION is done - this allows you to register with a 
    SIP Proxy (for instance, divmod.com)
  - The 'guts' of Shtoom are now in shtoom.app - the new Application
    object controls most of the behaviour of the phone. It creates 
    SIP, RTP and UI objects and handles the communication between them.
  - Major refactoring of the UI selection code
  - UPnP discovery is working, but not hooked up (not much point until
    the UPnP-using code is done).
  

0.1: RELEASED 2004-01-11. 
  - Initial basic calling UI done, for Tk, Gnome, Qt/KDE and command 
    line
  - Audio using either ossaudiodev or portaudio/fastaudio
  - Can make and receive calls
  - Supports firewall traversal via STUN
  - Uses either PCMU (8KHz ULAW, default) or GSM 06.10 (if optional
    pygsm module is installed).
