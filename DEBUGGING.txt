Notes on sound drivers under Linux
----------------------------------

ALSA is preferred in all cases. It Just Works. Sound drivers before 
ALSA on Linux are somewhere between a shambles and a bloody shambles.

There are some sound drivers that are just screwed. Non ALSA drivers 
having problems:

  i810_audio
  trident

If you have one of these, you're boned. Install ALSA.

Determining your sound driver
-----------------------------

Use this command:

  /sbin/lsmod | grep soundcore

For ALSA, it will produce something like 

soundcore              10720  1 snd

The 'snd' is the base ALSA module. For non-ALSA, you'll get 
something like

soundcore              10720  1 i810_audio
