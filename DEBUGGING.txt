Debugging
---------

Some notes on helping you debug shtoom. There's a bit more 
attitude in this file than you might think necessary. I 
apologise - many of these problems are a source of some 
frustration and annoyance to me, so this venting is probably
healthy for me <wink>

Testing
-------

Some test addresses to try calling:

  sip:613@fwd.pulver.com -- An echo test

  sip:testcall@divmod.com -- Plays a short audio file to you

  sip:echotest@divmod.com -- Another echo test
  

Firewalls
---------

Firewalls are the absolute BANE of VoIP and SIP. If the firewall
is well designed and modern, it should work just fine. If not...
well, we'll come to some possible solutions to that.

First test - in shtoom/, there is a file 'stun.py'. This can be
run as a script, and should at least let you know if UDP packets
can get in and out of your network. If you run it and get no 
response, then your firewall is blocking it.

You can force a solution to this with the 'force_rtp_port' to 
force shtoom to use a particular RTP port, then manually set your
firewall to forward this port back to your machine. This is 
kind of hacky, but works.

If you're looking at a firewall, the thing you are looking for
is "stateful UDP filtering". That is, if a UDP packet goes out,
it lets the reply back in. There's a bunch of firewalls that 
will do this, but _only_ for DNS packets. Wonderful. 

Going forward, I will hopefully finish the UPnP support so that
those running firewalls which support this can use this. 

Sound
-----

The next big issue with shtoom is getting audio to work. There's a
simple script 'shreadder.py' that uses the shtoom audio layer to
test with. It reads from the audio device and writes audio back to
it, spitting out some numbers about the power level of the audio.
Use this to test your audio setup. Note that under ALSA on Linux,
all audio devices start muted. Use alsamixer to unmute them. (Yes,
this is stupid, no, I don't know why they made that choice).

Notes on sound drivers under Linux
----------------------------------

ALSA is preferred in all cases. It Just Works. Sound drivers before 
ALSA on Linux are somewhere between a shambles and a bloody shambles.

There are some sound drivers that are just screwed. Non ALSA drivers 
having problems:

  i810_audio
  trident
  <insert your dodgy sound driver here>

If you have one of these, you're boned. Install ALSA. If you can't/
won't upgrade to a Linux 2.6 kernel, find a version for your system.

For Redhat/Fedora users, look at the Planet CCRMA project, 
http://www-ccrma.stanford.edu/
It provides packaged versions of all of this.

Debian users should look for the alsa-base package. I've been advised
that "dpkg-reconfigure alsa-base" will allow you to set it up and 
select your sound card (for instance).

For others, go to http://www.alsa-project.org/

Yes, in theory it _should_ be possible to make your existing sound
driver work. But I'm not able to spend the time to do so -- there's
far more useful things I can be working on. If you want to try and
figure out your sound driver, and contribute fixes or documentation
on how to make it work, please, do so! I will happily include the
documentation here, and credit you for it. As a first pointer, note
that shtoom opens the audio device in mono mode. At least for the
i810_audio driver, this just Does Not Work. I'm not interested in
trying to fudge around this by merging the stereo audio into a mono
signal.


Determining your sound driver
-----------------------------

Use this command:

  /sbin/lsmod | grep soundcore

For ALSA, it will produce something like 

soundcore              10720  1 snd

The 'snd' is the base ALSA module. For non-ALSA, you'll get 
something like

soundcore              10720  1 i810_audio

Sound drivers under Windows
---------------------------

Under Windows, we use the PortAudio package. By default, this 
uses the default windows sound device. You can alter this through
the control panel. There's also some environment variables you can
set to choose a different device:

  XXX TODO.


Unsorted Notes
--------------

exarkun reports, on selecting the correct sound driver under ALSA:
my card is "ALi Corporation M5451".  w/ oss, it was using the trident 
driver.  There is also an alsa driver for trident cards, but it does 
not work.  The "ALi M5451" alsa driver does, though.
