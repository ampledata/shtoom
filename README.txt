Shtoom is a pure-python VoIP client, using SIP.

At the moment it's functionality is pretty limited, but is growing
quickly:

  - Qt user interface
  - Can make simple calls and hang them up
  - Uses the G711 ULAW codec by default 

If available, it will make use of the itimer module.

and thanks to everyone on the Twisted project for producing such a 
high quality framework.
