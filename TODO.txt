Before 0.2:
    - SIP registration. We can use STUN to allow the INVITEs back from the
      server that we register with.
    - Finish Tkinter GUI
    - Re-hookup the debugging log to the GUI
    - Integrate existing RTCP code
    - lots more error handling
    - Hang up a phone call that is still "ringing":
      1. doesn't seem to stop RTP/RTCP udp ports
      2. if called broken address (e.g. "sip:") can't hang up
    - EsounD support for Gnome, aRts for KDE?
      Note that aRts (and, I suspect, esd) only handle playing of audio,
      not the recording of audio.
    - UPnP support in order to bust out of NAT. Anthony now has a Netgear
      that supports UPnP (Thanks, divmod!) Specs are available from
      http://www.upnp.org/resources/documents.asp
      See also http://icepick.info/index.php?p=175
      UPnP could be used just for the SIP port, then STUN for the RTP/RTCP,
      or else use UPnP for all 3.
    - Handle more of SIP 
        - Lookup servers/proxies using multicast, SRV
        - redirects, auth
        - retransmits &c
        - Merge shtoom.multicast.SDP.SDP and shtoom.multicast.SDP.SimpleSDP 
          into shtoom.sdp, kill shtoom.multicast
    - Codec switchability - DVI4?, Speex, GSM

Later:

    - Statistics display
    - Preferences storage
    - New codec support: 
        - G723?
        - iLBC?
    - Support RTP NTE (RFC2833)
      Uses SDP of 'a=rtpmap:101 telephone-event/8000'
    - More clients - shtam (answering machine), shtoomcu (conferencing server)
    - Putting calls on hold, allowing multiple calls to go at once.
    - Gnome addressbook integration. Gnome notification bar integration.
    - KDE addressbook integration. KDE panel integration.
    - Mac OS X UI and addressbook integration.
    - Mac OS CoreAudio support for Mac audio
    - Native Windows audio - see 
      http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~hgs/teaching/ais/slides/windows_audio.ppt
      for an overview - DirectSound or DirectKS. It appears that WinMM isn't
      suitable.
    - Windows address book? Is there such a beast? Windows Messenger?
    - PGP integration for SIP
    - Crypto for RTP (via codec? what's the standard?)
