Mac installer: bundlebuilder
Windows installer: Innoconda, py2exe
Linux installer: rpmbuilder??

Before 0.2:
    - Nag itamar into writing the GNOME prefs ;)
    - Handle changed prefs, re-init whatever's needed
    - authCred support in shtoom.app
    - A way to prompt for user, password information
    - A way to popup an information dialog
    - Finish test driver using new shtoom.app layer. 
    - Fix the fastaudio windows distribution - it needs to include the 
      libsndfile.dll file. I might need to switch to using Inno Setup -
      but how does Inno Setup know where to install the executable? How
      does wininst.exe build an installer? Default to C:\Python23 ?
    - Examine py2exe 0.5
    - Connect up and debug shutdown hooks for removing registration and 
      closing any open calls (dropCall needs to return a deferred)
    - Finish Tkinter GUI
    - Re-hookup the debugging log to the GUI for all GUIs - maybe need
      a hide/show option
    - Integrate existing RTCP code
    - lots more error handling
    - Hang up a phone call that is still "ringing":
      1. doesn't seem to stop RTP/RTCP udp ports
      2. if called broken address (e.g. "sip:") can't hang up

Before 0.3:
    - UPnP: Hookup the discovery code in shtoom.upnp. 
    - UPnP: Finish forwardPort and cancelForwardPort. 
      Annoyingly, it doesn't seem like responses include some sort 
      of response cookie to indicate which query it is for.
      Needs SOAP client in Twisted 1.1.2.
    - Handle more of SIP 
        - Lookup servers/proxies using multicast, SRV
        - redirects
        - retransmits &c
        - Merge shtoom.multicast.SDP.SDP and shtoom.multicast.SDP.SimpleSDP 
          into shtoom.sdp, kill shtoom.multicast
    - Codec switchability - DVI4?, Speex
    - EsounD support for Gnome, aRts for KDE?
      Note that aRts (and, I suspect, esd) only handle playing of audio,
      not the recording of audio.

Later:

    - Statistics display
    - New codec support: 
        - G723?
        - iLBC?
    - Support RTP NTE (RFC2833)
      Uses SDP of 'a=rtpmap:101 telephone-event/8000'
    - More clients - shtam (answering machine), shtoomcu (conferencing server)
    - Putting calls on hold, allowing multiple calls to go at once.
    - Alternately, ad-hoc conferencing of new inbound or outbound calls
    - Gnome addressbook integration. Gnome notification bar integration.
    - KDE addressbook integration. KDE panel integration.
    - Mac OS X UI and addressbook integration.
    - Mac OS CoreAudio support for Mac audio - fzzzy is working on this.
    - Native Windows audio - see 
      http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~hgs/teaching/ais/slides/windows_audio.ppt
      for an overview - DirectSound or DirectKS. It appears that WinMM isn't
      suitable.
    - Windows address book? Is there such a beast? Windows Messenger?
    - PGP integration for SIP
    - Crypto for RTP (via codec? what's the standard?)
    - Video. Capture is the tricky bit in a cross-platform way. Mac OSX
      already has a videocapture module.
