Before 0.1:
    - Test and fix Windows audio
    - Finish Tkinter GUI
    - Re-hookup the debugging log to the GUI
    - Integrate existing RTCP code
    - lots more error handling
    - Hang up a phone call that is still "ringing":
      1. doesn't seem to stop RTP/RTCP udp ports
      2. if called broken address (e.g. "sip:") can't hang up

Before 0.2:
    - UPnP support in order to bust out of NAT. Anthony now has a Netgear
      that supports UPnP (Thanks, divmod!) Specs are available from
      http://www.upnp.org/resources/standards.asp
      See also http://icepick.info/index.php?p=175
    - Handle more of SIP 
        - registration
        - Lookup servers/proxies using multicast, SRV
        - redirects, auth
        - retransmits &c
        - Merge shtoom.multicast.SDP.SDP and shtoom.multicast.SDP.SimpleSDP 
          into shtoom.sdp, kill shtoom.multicast
    - Codec switchability - DVI4?, Speex, GSM

Later:
    - Statistics display
    - Preferences storage
    - New codec support: 
        - G723?
        - iLBC?
    - Support RTP NTE (RFC2833)
      Uses SDP of 'a=rtpmap:101 telephone-event/8000'
    - More clients - shtam (answering machine), shtoomcu (conferencing server)
    - Putting calls on hold, allowing multiple calls to go at once.
    - Gnome addressbook integration. Gnome notification bar integration.
    - KDE addressbook integration. KDE panel integration.
    - Mac OS X UI and addressbook integration.
    - Mac OS CoreAudio support for Mac audio
    - Windows address book? Is there such a beast?
